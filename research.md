**Summary of research interests**

* Statistical Genomics
* Multiple Hypothesis Testing
* Test of Association
* Statistical Learning and Kernel Methods
* High-dimensional Data Analysis
* Multivariate Analysis
* Longitudinal Data Analysis
* Clinical Biostatistics

My primary research interests lie broadly in developing statistical methodologies for large biological data sets such as 'omics' data sets. In particular, my interest span several areas such as test of association, expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) analysis, kernel machine methods, multiple hypothesis testing, longitudinal data analysis and multivariate methods. Although my research interests are varied, they are all motivated by real-world problems.

In addition to my methodological research, I have also conducted extensive interdisciplinary and collaborative research. Collaboration is an essential component of my research activities. While it helps to establish a bridge between statistical theory and its applications to real life problems, it also inspires evolution of novel methodologies. I look forward to new collaboration opportunities in future.


**Some ongoing research work**

Currently I am involved in a project with mass cytometry (CyTOF) data where we aim to develop a new statistical methodology to find association between the compositional profile of immune cell types and other clinical/demographic variables. We propose a kernel-based method to test such association. Our proposed method tends to perform better than the existing univariate methods which test for each cell type individually. See <a href = "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2021/05/10/2021.05.08.443265.full.pdf" target = "_blank">bioRxiv</a> for a preprint.

In another project, I am working on finding patterns of auditory co-morbidities for patients with intellectual disabilities. It involves mining a large data set from two hospitals in the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Center. 

I am involved in several other ongoing research projects including methodology development in the field of multiple testing and interdisciplinary work in collaboration with clinical researchers.
