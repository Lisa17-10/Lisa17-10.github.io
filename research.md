**Summary of research interests**

* Statistical Genomics
* Multiple Hypothesis Testing
* Test of Association
* Statistical Learning and Kernel Methods
* High-dimensional Data Analysis
* Multivariate Analysis
* Longitudinal Data Analysis

My primary research interests lie broadly in developing statistical methodologies for large biological data sets such as omics data sets. In particular, my interest span several areas such as test of association, expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) analysis, kernel machine methods, multiple hypothesis testing, longitudinal data analysis and multivariate methods. Although my research interests are varied, they are all motivated by real-world problems.

In addition to my methodological research, I have also conducted extensive interdisciplinary and collaborative research. Collaboration is an essential component of my research activities. While it helps to establish a bridge between statistical theory and its applications to real life problems, it also inspires evolution of novel methodologies. I look forward to new collaboration opportunities in future.
