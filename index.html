<h3> What are the Wingmates up to? </h3>

We have taken a couple of trips in 2022 and now visiting our home country India after a very long time. Of course we are birding and photographing everywhere we go, and we look forward to sharing some stories with you. We wish we had more time to process our photos and write the blogs we plan to. It's hard when you have another full time job. Trying to catch up soon!

<br>
Meanwhile, we have added some new features on this website. For example, check the page with some of our <a href="https://www.wing-mates.com/featured/">featured photos</a>, or become a <a href="https://www.wing-mates.com/friends/">friend of Wingmates</a> to motivate us or to get the most recent updates from us.


<br>
<br>
The blogs that we are really looking forward to putting up are our experiences from Hawaii. We have been quite busy with work over the last few months making it hard to sit down and process all the photos. We anticipate to have the Hawaii blogs ready very soon. Â
