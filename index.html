These elegant birds were quite fast for us to catch in action consistenty, but we were able to get some areal action thanks to improved autofocus of modern mirrorless cameras. We have shared some photos from the series on social media. This is one that we haven't shared, but really like as a contender for 'photo of the month'. </span> </b> </center>

<h3> What are the Wingmates up to? </h3>

We have taken a couple of trips in 2022 and now visiting our home country India after a very long time. Of course we are birding and photographing everywhere we go, and we look forward to sharing some stories with you. We wish we had more time to process our photos and write the blogs we plan to. It's hard when you have another full time job. Trying to catch up soon!

<br> However, the blogs that we are really looking forward to putting up are our experiences from Hawaii. We have been quite busy with work over the last few months making it hard to sit down and process all the photos. We anticipate to have the Hawaii blogs ready very soon. Â
