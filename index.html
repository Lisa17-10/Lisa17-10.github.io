<h3> What are the Wingmates up to? </h3>
We just came back after spedning a wonderful two weeks in the Hawaiian islands. It's the beginning of the spring semester, so both of us are busy with the onboarding. But we are working on the thousands of images we got from our trip and will soon share some with you. Still some catching up to do with the photos from last fall, which is coming next!
