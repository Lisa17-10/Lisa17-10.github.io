<h3> What are the Wingmates up to? </h3>
We have taken a couple of trips this summer and got some wonderful photo opportunities. Really excited to share them! Our backyard and local birding have also been quite productive this spring. We wish we had more time to process more of our photos and write the blogs we plan to. It's hard when you have another full time job. Trying to catch up soon!
However, the blogs that we are really looking forward to putting up are our experiences from Hawaii. Few months ago, we spent wonderful two weeks in the Hawaiian islands. It was both fulflling and sad to know more about the natural history of the native flora and fauna of Hawaii. We will soon write about that and share with you. But we have been quite busy with work over the last few months making it hard to sit down and process all the photos. We anticipate to have the Hawaii blogs ready by September.
