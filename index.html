<h3> What are the Wingmates up to? </h3>
We just came back after spending a wonderful two weeks in the Hawaiian islands. It was both fulflling and sad to know more about the natural history of the native flora and fauna of Hawaii. We plan to write about that and share with you. But it's the beginning of the spring semester; so both of us are busy with the onboarding. At the same time, we are working on the thousands of images we got from our trip and will soon share some with you. Still some catching up to do with the photos from last fall, which is coming next!
