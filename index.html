<h3> What are the Wingmates up to? </h3>

We recently had a very important life event, and those of you who follow us on social media probably know what I am talking about. We have added more about it in the <a href="https://www.wing-mates.com/aboutme/">About us</a> section. Family and work kept us extremely busy in recent times. We wish we had more time to process our photos and write the blogs we plan to. Trying to catch up soon!

<br>
<br>

Meanwhile, we have added some new features on this website. For example, check the page with some of our <a href="https://www.wing-mates.com/featured/">featured photos</a>, or become a <a href="https://www.wing-mates.com/friends/">friend of Wingmates</a> to motivate us or to get the most recent updates from us. We are keeping the photos of the month page updated! 


<br>
<br>
We are are starting to get back to writing the Oklahoma Diaries series, but it won't be a separate blog for every month anytime soon. Perhaps one every season? 
We have also started to post some shorter pieces when we have a sequence of images that tells a story, but not in a mood to write a longer blog. We call these "shorts", and hope to post them more often. An archive of these can be found <a href="https://www.wing-mates.com/tags/#Short">here</a>. 
<br>
<br>

Even though we didn't get too much time to go out birding in recent times, it doesn't mean we don't have enough photos to share! In fact, there are hundreds of unedited photos that we would love to post. We will be in the "Throwback Thursday" mode in the near future and write about exciting experiences from the past two years that we always wanted to share. These might end up being more frequent than the Oklahoma Diaries series. We are looking forward to these. Hopefully you will enjoy them too!
