title: Photo of the month

We started this section post one-year anniversary of 'Wingmates'. We hope you will like our favorites from each month.
See photos of the months of 2022 below. Older photos will be archived as we move forward... 

**Photo of November**

*<span style="font-size: 0.75em;">'That tree' photographed by Sreemala: Some of you who follow our photography may remember an image of this tree I took three years ago. It was a favorite of mine. This November, we went to this park again. It's typical of this spot to have some nice fog at dawn and the colorful leaves create a wonderful contrast. This time around it was a cloudy morning, and unfortunately, the leaves had already turned brown. So, it wasn't looking very photogenic. As were about to leave, the sun peaked through the cloud and suddenly the leaves that looked brown a few minutes ago turned vibrant orange lit by the golden light of the sun! We captured several photos, me with the longer lens and Pratyay with the wider one. I was quite happy with the outcome. The cormorant flying by was a nice bonus! </span>*

**Photo of October**

*<span style="font-size: 0.75em;">Gulf Fritillary photographed by Pratyay: My favorite butterfly from our area. The bright orange of the dorsal side of the wings is nice enough, but the beautiful colors and patterns under the wing are too good to ignore. Sreemala is the butterfly in flight expert, but she has been really busy with other things this fall. So, I tried to get some decent flight shots this time around. Hope you like this one. </span>*

**Photo of September**

*<span style="font-size: 0.75em;">Ruby-throated Hummingbird photographed by Pratyay: September is the hummingbird month as the little ones come to the feeder very frequently to gather all the energy they need before they migrate. 
We call this bird "One Ruby" since this immature bird is just starting to get the ruby colored feathers on its throat. He is quite territorial and would attack and chase away all the adult males from the feeder area. Then it would come back to its favorite twig and do some stretching and preening. I was very happy to get this backlit photo of One Ruby stretching its tail feathers.</span>*

**Photo of August**

*<span style="font-size: 0.75em;">Nine-banded Armadillo photographed by Pratyay: This was one of those rare days when I was out taking photos alone since Sreemala has some work. She dropped me at the lake and was supposed to pick me up after sunset. It was a really good day. The sunset was amazing! After having a good time with scissortails and Purple Martins, I was finally planning to end the day with some sunset silhouettes when I noticed something unexpected in my frame. An armadillo right against the colorful sky! </span>*

*<span style="font-size: 0.75em;">I had photographed Nine-banded Armadillos several times at this park, but never close to the lake or with sunset clouds in the background. I was far away frtom the animal when I saw it. So, I silently moved towards it. These animals don't see well, and unless the wind is blowing the wrong way, it's not difficult to have them cooperate for photography. Once I was close enough, I got low and captured some images that I liked. I enjoyed this session while lying on the ground trying to be as low as possible while the armadillo kept doing its thing. I hope you like the outcome. The conditions needed that I process the image in this HDR-ish fashion which I typically don't do, but I think it gives the photo an even more prehistoric feel. Check out our social media pages for some other photos where I created a different silhouetted look.

**Photo of July**

*<span style="font-size: 0.75em;">Scissor-tailed Flycatcher photographed by Pratyay: When we moved to North-central Oklahoma four years ago, Sreemala and I, both birders and photographers, were not very hopeful about the bird photography opportunities in this part of the country. Given the fact that we had stayed in places with amazing photo ops in both the Eastern and Western part of the US, there were very little new things we could get, except, of course, the chance to photograph inarguably the best state bird of all states on its breeding ground. Over the last couple years we have got many photos of these Scissor-tailed Flycatchers that we liked. It gives me great joy to look back at their photos and videos (all are not even edited yet) and think about the enjoyable time we spent with them.</span>*

*<span style="font-size: 0.75em;">This year, one of our goals was to capture them in flight against backgrounds different from the boring blue sky and capture some more photos/videos showing their behaviors. It needs quite a bit of patience, but I think we are getting there. Hope you like this view in front of our local lake. </span>*
