*<span style="font-size: 0.75em;">Nine-banded Armadillo photographed by Pratyay: This was one of those rare days when I was out taking photos alone since Sreemala has some work. She dropped me at the lake and was supposed to pick me up after sunset. It was a really good day. The sunset was amazing! After having a good time with scissortails and Purple Martins, I was finally planning to end the day with some sunset silhouettes when I noticed something unexpected in my frame. An armadillo right against the colorful sky. I have photographed Nine-banded Armadillos several times at this park, but never close to the lake or with sunset clouds in the background. I wasn't close to the animal when I saw it. So, I silently moved towards it. These animals don't see well, and unless the wind is blowing the wrong way, it's not difficult to have them cooperate for photography. Once I was close enough, I got low and captured some images that I liked. I enjoyed this session while lying on the ground trying to be as low as possible as the armadillo kept doing its thing. I hope you like the outcome. The conditions needed that I process the image in this HDR-ish fashion which I typically don't do, but I think it gives the photo an even more prehistoric feel. Check our social media pages for another photo where I created a different silhouetted look.
