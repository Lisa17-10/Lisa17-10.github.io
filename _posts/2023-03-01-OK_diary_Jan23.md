In our last blog (posted a lifetime ago), we showed you some glimpses of our visit to India. We thought that it would be nice to look back at the rest of that trip. So here it is assuming you are ready for many many photos that we enjoyed capturing during the second part of the trip! We were surprised how many different bird species we could photograph within a span of just a few days without going for any longer hikes as Sreemala was in her second trimester of pregnancy. Our rule for this India trip was that we would bird only within a 10 minute radius from wherever we were staying. However, we had several different places where we stayed, and that resulted in a nice variety of habitats and colorful assortment of birds…
The new year started with us visiting Pratyay’s hometown Santiniketan for a whole week. We hopped on to the train from Howrah Railway Station (one of the oldest, largest & busiest in Eastern India). We were already seeing so many birds through the window of the train as we kept going towards our destination. After we reached Santiniketan, the rooftop terrace quickly became our favorite spot to watch, listen and photograph some of the beautiful birds without going too far. Winter in India is not too cold. Afternoons can be especially pleasing to be outside and just enjoy the time with our feathered friends.

Asok jethu, one of our neighbors, has big trees on their property and the birds love visiting the trees. One tree that attracted so many birds was an ‘amra’ (hog palm) tree. The ripe yellow fruits can be attractive to both birds and humans alike! Our telephoto lenses were exactly the Instrument we needed to photograph them from our terrace.

Asok jethu and Shyamali jethima were our birding buddies when they took us for a morning stroll and shared their hotspots for some neighborhood birds. A Stork-billed Kingfisher was a nice surprise to add to the list of other common species we saw out there.

The big fields around Baganpara where Pratyay used to spend his childhood afternoons playing soccer or cricket are now all walled up and it’s hard to access them. This land belongs to Visva Bharati who decided to put up these walls several years ago. We managed to sneak in and spend time around the field and the Binay Bhavana area to find some more interesting birds.

*<span style="font-size: 0.75em;">Growing up, he played soccer many  times on this very field. Seemed like it would be hard to score a goal now. Not just because of all the tall grasses near the abandoned goalposts, but the defense line also seemed to be pretty strong.</span>*

Sreemala could not join Pratyay during his last India trip and she was jealous looking at some of the bee-eater photos taken by him during that trip. These fast little birds are quite common around Santiniketan, but it’s not always easy to catch them in flight. Getting some nice photos of this bird was big in her bucket list. However, we were not really well-prepared when we got to spend some time with them. For example, we didn’t have the right attire bird photography. Spending hours wearing a saree on the agricultural land divider was quite the way to photograph these birds in action!

When the bee-eaters took a break, Asian Palm Swifts kept us busy. These fast birds are super challenging to catch in flight as they flew over the paddy fields. But we managed to get some wing positions. The pond herns were relatively more cooperative, and obviously less erratic.

As we wrapped up our days in Santiniketan we went out for a leisurely stroll in Ballavpur wildlife sanctuary and deer park to spot and photograph some more orioles, kingfishers, and parakeets. A Gray Wagtail, Oriental Honey Buzzard, Blyth’s Reed Warbler, Tickel’s Leaf Warbler, and Black-winged Cuckooshrike were some nice finds. All of them were lifers for both of us.

As we headed back to Kolkata, only a week was left before we headed back home to Stillwater. Our last adventure together was to visit a somewhat famous birding spot very close to our apartment. Chintamani Kar bird sanctuary which was quite famous in the past for some extraordinary bird sightings. It’s probably not as good as it used to be in the past, but it still resulted in some exciting new species such as Black-headed Cuckooshrike, Cinereous Tit, Orange-headed Thrush, Bronzed as well as Ashy Drongo, Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker and large-tailed Nightjar. But the best part was the White-throated Fantails singing from inside thick vegetation throughout the park.

After spending a nice time in India, it was time to come back to Stillwater. The return flight was quite exhausting as Indigo and Turkish Airlines provided a pretty poor service. After being back home to Stillwater, we stayed at home as we needed some rest, and we were perfectly happy doing some window birding watching our common backyard species visiting the feeders. We had snow one day. Snow always makes Sreemala happy! I doubt if the birds were very happy with the colder weather. We especially felt bad for the Cardinal without feathers. It did not look like regular molt. Perhaps some kind of disease? Not sure if it made through the winter. All we could make sure was to have enough food for it and it seemed to make full use of that.

So long from Stillwater. We will come back with the next chapter of Oklahoma Diaries soon!
