Just to be clear, this short post has nothing to do with the British Royal Family. This is about an exciting moment from earlier this summer when we came across our first Diana Fritillary! 

This male Diana was nectaring on the butterfly milkweed when the Monarch flew in.

Mr Fritillary wasn't happy at all. There was some kickboxing that took place at this point and there was a clear winner... Any guess who it was?

Diana was able to stand its ground. The Monarch finally gave up and took off.

It was a fun moment for our butterfly action photography endeavors and this series was one of the highlights from the very few outings that we had this year.
