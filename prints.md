If you love nature, wildlife and birds and would like to own any of our prints or photobooks, please let us know via one of the Wingmates social media handles or email us. We have now spent almost half a decade in photographing birds and nature. Our goal has been to capture nature in its purest form while maintaining and valuing nature the most. 
You can choose any image we shared here or on social media. Below are some photo books we have printed in the past, and we plan to make some more in the future. We do not intend to profit from selling images at this time. You will only have to pay for the printing and shipping costs. However, we ask that for every image ‘purchased’, you consider donating any amount that you feel appropriate to an organization that actively works towards nature conservation. We will leave it up to you the choice of the organization and the amount of donation, but let us know if you need suggestions. Currently, this is only available to friends and people we personally know. 
Feel free to contact us at one of the Wingmates social media handle for any queries.
